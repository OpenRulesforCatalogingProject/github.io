Series are usually created by the publisher. A publisher assigns a
separate Series title to a group of resources (such as books, DVDs,
periodicals, etc.) that have a common subject or theme. They may or may
not be numbered.

## 060100. Series title

**Definition:** The Series title is the title of a comprehensive
publication of which the resource is a part; includes the ISSN if known.

-   Source: BIBFRAME \"[Series](https://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe.html#c_Series){:target="_blank"}\"; [LCRI 1.0](http://www.loc.gov/cds/PDFdownloads/csb/CSB_113.pdf){:target="_blank"} (p. 16).

**Rule:** Record the Series title in a series statement.

Transcribe the titles of all the series of which the resource is a part.
If there is an inaccuracy in the Series title, transcribe it as it
appears and add a note for the corrected version. If the Series title is
grammatically linked to the title of the item being cataloged, include
it in the Title proper, and transcribe it in a series statement.
Consider providing a controlled series added entry if required for
access.

If a resource does not bear a Series title but is known to be part of a
series, record the Series title and add a note justifying the addition. A
Series title may be found on an outside source, such as the publisher\'s
website or catalog. Additionally a cataloger may create a Series title
to bring together resources commonly treated as a series.
