The Open Rules for Cataloging (ORC) project was initiated in 2019 by Billey Albina of Bard College to create open access cataloging rules for the cataloging community. The project was on hiatus during most of 2020 and was revived in January 2021 by Denise Soufi (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) along with Faye Leibowitz (formerly of the University of Pittsburgh). The [Executive Board](/ORC/about/Directors/) oversees the project, and the rules are developed by the [Rules Committee](/ORC/about/Committees/).

Open Rules for Cataloging is a 501(c)(3) public charity incorporated on April 27, 2023.

Special thanks to the RBMS RDA Editorial Group who graciously allowed us to clone their GitHub repository as the basis for this website and provided guidance on workflows and other helpful advice for the development of this project. In particular: Jessica Grzegorski, Elizabeth Hobart, kalan Knudson Davis, and Amy Tims.
