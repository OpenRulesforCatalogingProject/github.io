The Open Rules for Cataloging (ORC) project was initiated in 2019 by Amber Billey of Bard College to create open access cataloging rules for the cataloging community. The project was on hiatus during most of 2020 and was revived in January 2021 by Denise Soufi (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) along with Faye Leibowitz (formerly of the University of Pittsburgh). It is currently co-led by Faye and Ann Kardos (University of Massachusetts Amherst).

Open Rules for Cataloging was incorporated as a nonprofit on April 27, 2023, and we are currently in the process of applying for federal nonprofit status.

Special thanks to the RBMS RDA Editorial Group who graciously allowed us clone their GitHub repository as the basis for this website and provided guidance on workflows and other helpful advice for the development of this project. In particular: Jessica Grzegorski, Elizabeth Hobart, kalan Knudson Davis, and Amy Tims.
