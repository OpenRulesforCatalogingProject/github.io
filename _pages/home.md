## Welcome!
{: .no_toc }

The Open Rules for Cataloging (ORC) project was initiated in 2019 to create open access cataloging rules for the cataloging community. It is proposed to be a freely available alternative for those who desire a less abstract cataloging code. Its premise is that it is possible to identify universal, time-honored cataloging concepts in preexisting cataloging rule sets which can be used as the base of a modern, ethical cataloging code. ORC is being built upon a reliable historical foundation to provide a helpful tool for the basic cataloging needs of the community. Members come from the United States and beyond and represent a variety of library types and backgrounds.

This website is ORC's temporary location where drafts of cataloging rules will be uploaded for community review. Once all rules are finalized, they will be posted to a new site for use by catalogers.

To find out more about ORC, visit our [About](/ORC/about/) page. Interested in joining? As a member of the ORC community, you will receive regular updates and have access to the project's Google Drive. To sign up, send a message to the [ORC Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/openrulesforcataloging). And be sure to follow us on our YouTube channel!
